# Superstore Sales Agent Tracker

Superstore, a well-known Canadian retailer, has expanded its operations into the USA, employing Sales Agents in each state. These agents are tasked with driving sales within their respective states. The Sales Manager seeks a dashboard to monitor Sales Agents' performance, allowing for comparison between the current year's sales data and that of the same period last year. This facilitates tracking of growth. Furthermore, the dashboard should include a breakdown of sales by category and subcategory, along with information on top-performing products. There are two excel data sources, one for the orders placed and second for the sales agent details or information. The dashboard can be accessed via this link [Superstore Sales Agent Tracker Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/nilay.patel6829/viz/SuperstoreSalesAgentAnalytics_17040936258610/Dashboard1)
